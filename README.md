### About me :wave:
Hi, my name is Edy. I started my career in customer service and project management, where I learned a lot about communication, problem-solving, and how to understand client needs and translate them into practical actions. For the past two years, I’ve been working as a Junior Frontend Programmer. During that time, I often performed testing on new features before they were released — and that’s when I discovered my real interest in software testing and quality assurance. And right now, I’m focusing on developing my career in the field of Manual Quality Assurance Testing.

<!--### My experience :office:
Being a junior software tester at Perfect Gym is my first professional position strictly in QA area. I have made a significant growth both in my tech and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and developped some know-how in test automation. In addition, in my previous job, one of my responsibilities was to oversee the correct operation of the internal system and report any bugs or defects to the administrators. I have grown very fond of this role, which has also made me interested in the QA path. My previous experience, although unrelated to the IT world, has allowed me to develop valuable soft skills in particular. -->
